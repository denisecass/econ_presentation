# Southern Water Corp Economic Analysis Presentation 
**Slide 1:**

WITH AN ESTIMATED 22.03% REDUCTION IN SURJEK’S REVENUES ($158 M LEFT) DUE TO THE MAINTENANCE OUTAGE, QUARTER 4 PRESENTS THE BEST BALANCE OF REVENUE-LOSS MITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO MARKET PRICING, AS OPPOSED TO QUARTER 2 WHICH REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST DEMAND (1,126,828 ML) AND WATER BALANCING MARKET PRICES ($55.96).

**Slide 2:**

OF THE THREE DESALINATION PLANTS, ALL THREE REMAIN PROFITABLE AT CURRENT MARKET PRICES BY A FAVOURABLE MARGIN; CLEARLY KOOTHA IS THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE ($25/ML) FOLLOWED BY JUTIK ($36/ML) AND LASTLY SURJEK ($54/ML) WHICH IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE JULY-2013 TO JUNE-2014 PERIOD. ​

**Slide 3:**

CONTRASTING THE COST TO PRODUCE AGAINST THE VOLUME OF WATER PRODUCED HIGHLIGHTS CLEAR ECONOMY OF SCALE WITH COSTS RAPIDLY DWINDLING ACROSS ALL PLANTS AS VOLUME SURGES, WITH THIS BEING PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE ACROSS THE KOOTHA AND SURJEK PLANTS WITH COSTS DROPPING AS MUCH AS 50%. 

**Slide 4:**

DRILLING DOWN FURTHER FROM A PRODUCT-PERSPECTIVE, REVEALS TWO DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF ELASTICITY WHERE SOFT WATER TENDS TO BE RELATIVELY PRICE ELASTIC REGARDLESS OF QUANTITY PURCHASED, WHILST HARDWATER IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF AN INELASTIC PRICE-TO-VOLUME RELATIONSHIP, ALTHOUGH HARD AND SOFT WATER COMBINED APPEAR TO SHOW AN ELASTIC RELATIONSHIP.​

**Slide 5:**

LASTLY, WHEN VIEWING THE ECONOMIC PRICING DATA FROM AN MICRO-PERSPECTIVE, IT IS INDICATIVE THAT HARD WATER IS SEEN AS MORE OF A ‘CORE’ PRODUCT THAN THAT OF SOFT WATER SINCE HARD WATER'S  PRICE REMAINS LARGELY INFLEXIBLE. HOWEVER, THE TREND FOR HARD AND SOFT WATER COMBINED SHOWS A SLIGHTLY FLEXIBLE PRICE AVERAGE.
